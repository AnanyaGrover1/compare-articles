Collins v. Yellen ,common_facts,"Both articles state that the Supreme Court gave President Joe Biden greater power to fire the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Mark Calabria, that oversees mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
They both state that the decision was made because the agency’s structure violates the Constitutional principle of separation of powers as it limited the President's ability to remove the agency's single director.
Both articles explain that the shareholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac challenged the 2012 agreement that directed the companies to send their profits to the U.S. Treasury.
The two articles say the Supreme Court's decision did not grant the shareholders' request to recoup the $124 billion paid to the government, effectively leaving the 2012 agreement in place. ","Supreme Court Ruling: Both articles report that the Supreme Court ruled the structure of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) unconstitutional because it violated the separation of powers principle, as it overly restricted the President’s ability to fire the head of the agency.
Impact on the President’s Authority: The ruling effectively increases presidential power, allowing President Joe Biden to remove Mark Calabria, the FHFA director nominated by President Donald Trump.
Shareholders’ Legal Challenge: Shareholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac argued against the FHFA’s structure and sought to overturn a 2012 agreement which has seen the companies paying the government billions in compensation for the taxpayer bailout they received.
Outcome for Shareholders: Both articles mention that the Supreme Court did not grant the shareholders the relief they were seeking to reclaim billions or to dismantle the 2012 agreement entirely.
Precedent from Previous Cases: The articles both draw parallels between this case and a previous year’s ruling regarding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, citing consistency in the Court's stance on the removal power of the president over federal agencies.","The Supreme Court ruled that the President has increased authority to remove the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), finding its structure unconstitutional as it violates the separation of powers.
The case in question, Collins v. Yellen, involved shareholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac arguing that the FHFA's structure was unconstitutional, and sought to overturn a 2012 agreement that requires these companies to pay the government billions in compensation for a taxpayer bailout they received.
The Supreme Court’s decision allowed President Joe Biden to replace Mark Calabria, a Trump appointee, as the head of the FHFA.
Both articles refer to the past 2012 agreement where Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had to return their earnings to the U.S. Treasury as a condition of their bailout during the 2008 financial crisis.
The articles note that, despite the Supreme Court upholding the constitutional challenge against the FHFA's structure, it did not grant the shareholders' other demands, leaving the 2012 agreement and the payments to the Treasury in place.","- Both articles agree that the Supreme Court ruled the structure of the FHFA as unconstitutional because it restricted the president's ability to remove the agency's head.

- The articles acknowledge that the Supreme Court's decision was influenced by a similar case from the previous year involving the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
