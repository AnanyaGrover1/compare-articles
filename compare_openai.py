        Frames are the way media outlets select, organize, and present information to the audience. For example, The UK
        media initially framed the migrant crisis in terms of negative economic impact, using dehumanizing language
        like "swarms of migrants" and "cockroaches." However, after the widely shared image of three-year-old Syrian
        Aylan Kurdi, the narrative shifted towards humanizing migrants, altering public perception.

        Viewpoints are defined as value-based opinions and attitudes. The viewpoint could be of the author of the
        news story or it could be presented through the inclusion of quotes and opinions that reflect the subjective
        values of individuals or groups. For instance, coverage of an environmental policy reducing carbon emissions
        may highlight perspectives of activists and experts supporting it, emphasizing the value of protecting the
        planet, while other stories may focus on opposing viewpoints of industry leaders, such as concerns about jobs
        being lost.

        Given the above information, perform the following task step by step:
            1. Read these articles about the same news event (the content is provided below) and understand them.
            2. Begin by identifying points where both articles agree on the news event's factual details.
            3. Then, pinpoint any factual discrepancies between the articles.
            4. Next, analyze the differences in frames between the articles.
            5. Now, analyze the differences in the viewpoints presented in each article.
            6. Finally, notice any selective omissions of information.

            Now, summarize the articles together in five sets of bullet points:

            * Upto five main points of agreement between the articles
            * Any points of factual disagreement
            * Differences in framing
            * Differences in viewpoints
            * Selective omissions
